# How to contribute

## Goals
The goal and scope of the component is simple – handle flash messages in an `ember-cli` app. 

## Where you can help
You can contribute code, design (maybe 'themes' for different kinds of flash messages?), write documentation, fix typos, raise issues and so on. There's more to open source contribution than just code! Any help is welcome, as long as the guidelines are followed.

## Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/poteto/ember-cli-flash.git`
* `cd ember-cli-flash`
* `yarn install`

## Linting

* `yarn run lint:js`
* `yarn run lint:js -- --fix`

## Running tests

* `ember test` – Runs the test suite on the current Ember version
* `ember test --server` – Runs the test suite in "watch mode"
* `yarn test` – Runs `ember try:each` to test your addon against multiple Ember versions

## Running the dummy application

* `ember serve`
* Visit the dummy application at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
