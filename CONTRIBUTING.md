# How to contribute

## Goals
The goal and scope of the component is simple â€“ handle flash messages in an `ember-cli` app. 

## Where you can help
You can contribute code, design (maybe 'themes' for different kinds of flash messages?), write documentation, fix typos, raise issues and so on. There's more to open source contribution than just code! Any help is welcome, as long as the guidelines are followed.

## Making changes
